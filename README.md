# Lean Code kata

## Description:
This kata is composed by several iterations of 10 minutes. At the beginning of each iteration the Product Owner introduces new requirements.

## Goals:
- simulate a project where the decisions taken change really fast.
- understand how legacy is created.
- reflect on how we behave in front of these changes.
